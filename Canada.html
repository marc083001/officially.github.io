<h3><u>Niagara Falls</h3></u>
<section>
If you haven't ticked Niagara Falls off your bucket list yet, you can't leave Toronto without taking a day trip to the magnificent waterfall, which is about 80 miles south on the other side of Lake Ontario. Around the main waterfall, there is plenty to do in town, whether you want to hit the casinos or go shopping. If the weather's right, consider taking a boat ride to get up close and personal with the waterfall's misty spray or enjoy the view from a distance at a restaurant with a view like Top of the Falls or Fallsview Dining.</section>

<h1><b>VICTORIA CANADA</b></h1>
<hr>
<h3><u>The Butchart Gardens</h3></u>
<section>Although the garden is a short drive from downtown Victoria, it is one of the premier tourist attractions in the area and worth taking the time to see. It's also a place you can visit several times a year to see the changes throughout the seasons. Even in winter, the gardens are a lovely sight, with an outdoor skating rink and a fabulous display of lights around Christmas.
The garden was started in 1904 by Jennie Butchart, wife of a wealthy quarry owner. She laid out a fragrant garden in this abandoned limestone quarry. Flourishing, not least because of the mild climate, the gardens have since been developed into a 20-hectare horticultural tour de force without rival in Canada.
The Italian garden, rose garden, Japanese garden, and sunken garden are among the loveliest. Open spaces among the pools, fountains, and the many exotic plants are used for artistic and musical performances.
To reach The Butchart Gardens, follow Highway 17A north for 22 kilometers to Brentwood Bay on the Saanich Peninsula.

<h3><u>Fairmont Empress Hotel</h3></u>
<section>Built in 1908 for Canadian Pacific, like the Château Frontenac in Québec City, the Fairmont Empress Hotel on the Inner Harbour is one of Victoria's best-loved landmarks. This historic hotel has hosted celebrities and famous people throughout the decades, including members of the British Monarchy.
Architect Francis M. Rattenbury designed the Empress, and entering the vast lobby of this luxurious hotel is like journeying back in time to before the First World War.
Enjoying Afternoon Tea, served with great style in the Lobby Lounge, is one of the most popular things to do if you are visiting the city. Be sure to make a reservation if you want to guarantee a spot.
An extension on the north side of the Empress Hotel houses a collection of several dozen scenes in miniature at Miniature World. The models of historical events, castles, and dollhouses captivate young and old alike.</section>

<h3><u>Parliament Buildings</h3></u>
<section>Dominating the south side of the Inner Harbour is the imposing seat of British Columbia's provincial government, the Parliament Buildings. Designed by Yorkshire architect Francis M. Rattenbury and erected in 1897, the imposing stone buildings have neat, orderly gardens and are very attractive in appearance – especially in the evening when lit by festoons of lights.
Perched high above the massive dome is a gilded statue of Captain George Vancouver (1757-98), who accomplished the first circumnavigation of Vancouver Island. Figures of famous personalities from the province embellish the façade. A large statue of Queen Victoria surveys the Inner Harbour from the terrace.
